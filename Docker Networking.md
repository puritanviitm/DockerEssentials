## Docker Networking
### Task 1: Create 2 containers and check the connectivity between them.
```
docker network ls
```
```
docker run -d --name ct1 alpine sleep 3600
```
```
docker run -d --name ct1 alpine sleep 3600
```
```
docker ps
```

### Task 2: Create a new docker bridge and check connectivity between containers of same bridge
```
docker network create --driver bridge ct-bridge1
```
```
docker network inspect ct-bridge1
```
```
docker network ls
```
```
docker run -it --network ct-bridge1 --name=ct-c1 busybox
```

Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
```
docker run -it --network ct-bridge1 --name=ct-c2 busybox
```
Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
```
docker network inspect ct-bridge1
```
```
docker ps
```
```
docker attach ct-c2
```
```
ip addr
```
```
ping -c 5 ct-c1
```
Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host

### Task 2: Create a new docker bridge and check connectivity between containers of different bridges
```
docker network create --driver bridge ct-bridge2
```
```
docker run -it --network ct-bridge2 --name=ct-c3 busybox
```
Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
```
docker run -it --network ct-bridge2 --name=ct-c4 busybox
```
Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
```
docker attach ct-c4
```
```
ping -c 5 ct-c3
```
```
ip addr
```
```
ping -c 5 ct-c1
```
```
ping -c 5 ct-c2
```

Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host

### Task 3: Using 'Docker network connect' command create a successful connection between containers of different bridges
```
docker network ls
```
```
docker network connect ct-bridge2 ct-c1
```
```
docker network inspect ct-bridge2
```
```
docker attach ct-c1
```
```
ping -c 5 ct-c4
```
```
ip addr
```
```
ip route
```

### Task 4: Launch a container to host network
```
docker run -it --network host --name=ct-c5 busybox
```
```
ip addr
```
```
ifconfig
```

Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
```
docker network inspect host
```

### Task 5: Launch a container to none network 
```
docker run -it --network none --name=ct-c6 busybox
```
```
ip addr
```
```
Press Ctrl+P+Q, to switch back to Host
